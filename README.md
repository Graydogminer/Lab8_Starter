1) Number 2 would be the best fit for the automated tests in my Recipe project development pipeline since it will allow the developer to run tests after completing a short amount of code to see if it works. Once it works, they are able to push it to github.
2) Yes
3) I would use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application because the message feature is a very important part of the application. Unit Testing will allow us to test the feature for a wide variety of scenarios.
4) I wouldn't use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application since there will be a lot of moving parts in the application. I believe it would be much easier to test this feature manually.
